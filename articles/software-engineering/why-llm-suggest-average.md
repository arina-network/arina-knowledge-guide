# Why LLMs suggest the “average” that doesn’t solve your problem

## Statistics doesn’t work for a single case

Modern decision-making is built on statistics. Metrics, dashboards, A/B tests, probabilities—all of it assumes one simple thing: you are dealing with many cases, not one.
But in real life, most important problems are not statistical. They are singular.

And this is exactly where both classical statistics and modern LLMs start to fail you.

## Statistics is about distributions, not events

Statistics doesn’t describe reality. It describes distributions of possible realities.

When you hear:
- “90% success rate”
- “Average salary is $X”
- “Most users prefer option A”

What you’re actually hearing is:
> “In a large number of similar situations, this pattern tends to appear.”

But your situation is not a distribution. It is a single trajectory through time.
- There is no “average startup.”
- There is no “average career.”
- There is no “average production outage.”

There is only:
- your system
- your constraints
- your timing

And these are always unique.

## The hidden assumption: Repeatability

Statistics works only when:
- Events are repeatable
- Conditions are similar
- Variance is bounded

Break any of these—and statistical intuition collapses. Real-world engineering problems violate all three:
- Systems evolve
- Context shifts
- Unknown variables dominate

You don’t debug a million production incidents. You debug this one, under pressure, with incomplete information.
And “statistically likely causes” often don’t matter.

## The single-case problem

In a single case, probability is meaningless in the way people use it.

Saying:
> “This fix works in 80% of cases”

Does not answer:
> “Will it work now?”

Because:
- You don’t know which 20% you’re in
- You don’t know if your case even belongs to that distribution

This is the core mistake:
> Applying population-level reasoning to an individual instance.

It’s like using average body temperature to diagnose a specific patient.

## LLMs: engines of statistical averaging

Large Language Models are, fundamentally, statistical machines.

They don’t:
- understand your system
- simulate reality
- reason from first principles (in the strict sense)

They:
- predict the most probable continuation of text
- based on patterns seen across millions of examples

So when you ask an LLM for advice, what you get is:
> The statistically most common explanation or solution for problems that look similar to yours.

- Not your problem.
- Not your system.
- Not your constraints.

Just the center of mass of past data.

## Why the “Average Answer” fails
The average answer fails in exactly the cases where you need help the most:

### Edge cases
Your system behaves differently → LLM gives standard solution → doesn’t work

### Hidden constraints
Your environment has limitations → LLM assumes default conditions → mismatch

### Novel problems
Your situation is new → no historical pattern → LLM extrapolates incorrectly

### Asymmetric risk
Failure is expensive → “usually works” is not acceptable

## The Engineering reality: Determinism over Probability

Engineering is not about what usually works. It’s about what must work in this exact configuration.

That requires:
- understanding mechanisms
- building causal models
- testing hypotheses

Instead of:
- relying on averages
- copying patterns
- trusting “best practices”

A good engineer asks:
> “Why does this work?”

A statistical system answers:
> “It often works.”

These are fundamentally different modes of thinking.

## When Statistics Does Work

To be fair, statistics is extremely powerful when used correctly:
- Large-scale systems (traffic, load, user behavior)
- Optimization problems (A/B testing)
- Noise reduction (signal extraction)

But even there:
> Statistics helps you choose direction, not guarantee outcome.

## How to use LLMs without being misled

LLMs are useful—but only if you treat them correctly:

### Use them for:
- Generating hypotheses
- Exploring solution space
- Summarizing known patterns

### Do NOT use them for:
- Final decisions
- Root cause analysis
- High-risk problem solving

Think of an LLM as:

> A very fast intern with access to the internet who always answers confidently and is usually “kind of right”.

## The core insight

Statistics answers:
> “What usually happens?”

Reality asks:
> “What is happening now?”

LLMs answer:
> “What do people usually say about this?”

Engineering requires:
> “What is actually true in this system?”

## Final thought

If your problem is trivial, the average answer is enough.

If your problem matters, you must leave the world of averages. Because your failure will not be average. 

And your solution cannot be either.
